## Introduction

The Advanced Algorithms Showcase is a C# console application designed to explore various advanced algorithms, from solving the P vs NP problem to exploring the concept of Algorithmic Information Theory. This project serves as a hands-on demonstration of these complex algorithms, making them more accessible and understandable.

## Features

- **P vs NP Solver**: An experimental approach to the P vs NP problem.
- **Inverse-flux Algorithms**: Algorithms designed to handle inverse-flux calculations.
- **Search Algorithms**: Various search algorithms like Linear Search, Binary Search, etc.
- **Algorithmic Information Theory**: Metrics and estimations related to Algorithmic Information Theory, such as Shannon entropy, Kolmogorov complexity, and Levenshtein distance.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/mrrovy/ALG.git
    ```
2. Open the solution file (`AdvancedAlgorithms.sln`) in Visual Studio.
3. Build and run the project.

## Usage

Upon launching the application, you'll be presented with a menu to select the algorithm you want to run. Follow the on-screen prompts to proceed.

```bash
Please select an algorithm to execute:
1. P vs NP Solver
2. Inverse-flux Algorithms
